My mission is to empower individuals to connect and communicate through technology.

My current project is https://timeintent.com a time budgeting tool that also supports time tracking and task management.

Currently looking for voluteers to help with TimeIntent (Formerly "Deabute Plan"). Will likely open source the front end of the application. At the very least I would like to respect the spirit of open source with the project while supporting a subscrition based service to support the parent company.
