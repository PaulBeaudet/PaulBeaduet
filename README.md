My mission is to empower individuals to connect and communicate through technology.

My project, https://timeintent.com, is a personal time management tool.

After using the initial version of Time Intent for some years, I've developed a clear idea of what the application aspires to be based on its capabilities.

Time Intent can keep dreamers on point. 

Whether tracking time for work, play, or social, contrasting what was done versus what was intended pushes you to be on point.

The challenge is balancing many aspects of life in one tool while keeping the main point about the main pointâ€”your intent for your time.
